# The Influence of Salient Experiences on Hippocampal Neural Assemblies

## Functions
1. **Process** Loading the dataset
2. **Assembly.py**   From neuro_py package (based on Lopes-dos-Santos et al (2013))
3. **Assembly_reactivation.py** From neuro_py package 
4. **Assembly_plot.py** For plotting assembly patterns in CA1,CA2,CA3 and Joint CA1-CA2 and CA2-CA3, assembly activity overtime, and plotting similarities between cell assemblies in different conditions
5. **Correlation.py** For cross correlation

## Analysis

1. CCG between CA2 and CA3 cells after social and object interaction
2. Joint CA2-CA3 cell assembly activity and CA2 only cell assembly activity after social and object interaction
3. Peak reactivation strength for CA2-CA3, CA2, CA2-CA1 cell assemblies.
4. Similarity between Joint CA2-CA3 and CA2 only cell assemblies during social and object interaction
